    "\n000\nFXUS65 KMSO 042117\nAFDMSO\n\nArea Forecast Discussion\nNational Weather Service Missoula MT\n311 PM MDT Thu May 4 2023\n\n.DISCUSSION...Low pressure circulating across south central Idaho\nis throwing moisture northward into the Northern Rockies. The\naddition of an unstable air mass and warm temperatures has\nresulted in scattered showers across southwest Montana and Lemhi\ncounty, Id. This activity will continue to develop and move\nnorthward through this evening. Directional shear may lead to\nstronger storms across north central Idaho. Brief heavy rain, gusty\nwinds to 50 mph and small hail will occur with the stronger \nstorms. \n\nStrong storms will diminish overnight however showers will\nremain in the region. A mid level low pressure will soon after\nmove into central Idaho Friday and bring a return to numerous\nshowers and thunderstorms through the evening. The mid level\nfeature will move into northwest Montana Friday night where a\ndistinct boundary of rain will form and dump significant rains \nin this area throughout the day Saturday. A few thunderstorms will\nalso occur Saturday. Forecast precipitation totals have increased\nacross Northwest Montana through Saturday where one half to one\nquarter inch of rain is likely. The mountains there have a 70%\nprobability of receiving over one inch of rain. Similar rain\ntotals will occur across central Idaho. This will be a little help\nto these areas given the new drought monitor that came out today\nis showing severe drought conditions. \n\nWest Central and Southwest Montana have 70-80% probability of \nreceiving between one quarter and one half inch of rain through \nSaturday and only a 15% probability of one inch of rain in the \nmountains. \n\nAnother mid level low will rotate through the region Sunday\nafternoon through Tuesday resulting in another round of\nsignificant rains. \n\nThe remainder of next week will be showery with seasonal\ntemperatures, if one has forgotten is in the mid to upper 60s.\n\nA return to a period of dry and warmer than normal weather will\nreturn the weekend of 12th-16th. \n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...Gusty southerly to easterly winds will be an issue at\nall the terminal this afternoon. Also a spoke of energy from the\nlow pressure over northern California will be moving through the\nregion late this afternoon into the evening. This feature will\ngenerate numerous showers and thunderstorms. A few of these storms\ncould become quite strong causing small hail and wind gusts up to\n50 mph, especially over north central Idaho. Weak disturbances\nwill be tracking across the region throughout the night into\nFriday causing periods of showers across the region.\n\n&&\n\n\n.Hydrology...Area rivers and streams are continuing to rise, mainly driven by \nsnow melt from well above average temperatures this week.\nWidespread precipitation this weekend into early next week \nwill add to flooding concerns. Moderate to heavy rains will occur \nover north central Idaho and northwest Montana Friday and Saturday. \nA flood warning is in effect for the Clark Fork above Missoula which \nis at minor flood stage and is expected to remain above flood stage \ninto next week. Flood watches have been issued for a number of other \nlocations, including the Bitterroot River near Missoula, Bitterroot \nRiver at Bell Crossing, Clearwater River at Stites and Orofino, and \nthe Yaak River neat Troy. Additional stream rises are possible into \nthe weekend. \n\n&&\n\n\n.MSO WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...\nMT...ID...Flood Watch through Saturday afternoon for Northern \nClearwater Mountains...Orofino/Grangeville Region...Southern \nClearwater Mountains. \n\n&&\n\n$$\n",
